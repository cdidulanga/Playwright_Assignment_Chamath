# Playwright_Assignment_Chamath

This code base contains the assignment done for some basic playwright actions using wikipedia.

Clone the repo and execute npm init playwright@latest using the terminal and execute the tests.
The Typescript script is inside the test folder as it is the home directory. 
Config file is also pushed for use and reference.

The locator commands could have been using a page object model mechanism but since the actions were about locating and clicking once, page object model was not used. Doing all that to click and send back a value to be processed in the test I assumed as not the best practice.

Once the test is run, a new screenshots folder will be created and the screenshot commands will create the snips inside the folder. Since the instructions were not clear as to which page screenshots were required, the author took the liberty to get 2 screenshots : one during paul McCartney's wiki page and one in the John Lennon wiki page.
