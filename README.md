# Playwright_Assignment_Chamath

This code base contains the assignment done for some basic playwright actions using wikipedia.

Clone the repo and execute npm init playwright@latest using the terminal and execute the tests.
Make sure the playwright.config.ts file is accordingly.

The locator commands could have been using a page object model mechanism but since the actions were about locating and clicking once, page object model was not used. Doing all that to click and send back a value to be processed in the test I assumed as not the best practice.
